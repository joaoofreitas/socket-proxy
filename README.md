# Socket Proxy ðŸ”Œ

### What is Socket Proxy? ðŸ¤ 

Socket Proxy is basically as its name says, a Java Socket Proxy. It's a piece of software to get and send TCP packets from a client to a server. The advantage of this kind of software is that you can visualise and manipulate the data sent from the client of the server.

Even though this is a small project, it has no utility when used with this pack... This was a small challenge I purposed myself to do in [_Java_](www.java.com) since I'm pretty much new to the language.

This made me learn a little bit about:
- [x] Threading ðŸ§µ
- [x] Sockets ðŸ”Œ

### Why did I build this? â›©

I was watching some youtube, and I saw a guy that created a Socket for listening, decoding and manipulating raw data between a Game and a Server.
I found it really interesting and wanted to create something similar just for fun.

### Can I use this? ðŸš®
